    "## Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "As a Data Scientist in Healthcare with 2+ years of industry and work experience, one of the valuable pieces of knowledge that I learned on the job is that Zipcode (Postal Code) is indeed an important factor in determining an individual's health status (thus, wherever the individual lives can determine how healthy or unhealthy an individual can be). Also, healthcare, especially the quality of healthcare, is also an important factor in determining the standard of life of an area as well. However, many people may not be familiar with all the medical facilities that their area may provide or may not know the best one to go to based on what illness or medical condition that they may experience now. Thus, I created the EmergencyZIP AI to help individuals determine the best medical facilities to attend based on the symptoms or conditions that they may be experiencing right now, and to take greater consideration of zipcode/postal code as one of the most important factors of an individual's health status. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Case and Solution Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Individuals may want to know or curious about what current illness or medical condition that they may be facing at the moment, and the nearest and most appropriate medical facilities in their area that can best treat their illness or condition. I created EmergencyZip AI to utilize AI capabilities to not only inform the individual of what illness or condition that they may be facing now, but also inform the individual of the nearest appropriate medical facilities that can best treat the patient with great consideration of the zipcode/postal code as one of the most important factors of an individual's health status. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Innovation/Novelty\n",
    "\n",
    "While the internet is a powerful tool to use to research medical facilities available in the area, with so many search results provided, it can be messy and overwhelming at times to find the best medical facility for treatment of illnesses and medical conditions or even know what actual/potential illness or medical condition that the individual may be facing. With EmergencyZIP AI, the responses provided are tailored and focused only on the individual and the potential illness or medical condition that they are facing now. Also while doctors usually do a great job with diagnosing patients, there could be human bias or error that can be involved in the diagnosis process, so the AI takes in consideration of these potential biases (taking in consideration of patient demographic information) and gives the potentially most accurate diagnosis as possible without being biased (though one thing I can concede is that human doctors can recognize the nuances that AI can not do yet since data, especially that of the model has been trained on, is usually generalized). The AI is created to make information less overwhelming and more accessible and individualized for the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Process\n",
    "\n",
    "The AI utilizes Structured Output/JSON Mode/Controlled Generation, Few-Shot Prompting, and Grounding to operate. First, it uses JSON Mode to process patient demographic information and structures it to a formalized JSON form (just like filling out a patient form to receive medical care except simplier and more abstract). Then it utilizes Few-Shot Prompting and Structured Output/Controlled Generation to create a formalized request for the AI. Then it utilizes grounding to provide the best and most accurate potential diagnosis for the individual based on the current symptoms/conditions that the individual is facing now. Then using the diagnosis and the current zipcode of the individaul (the AI uses Few-Shot Prompting to extract the zipcode of the individual from the JSON form), the AI finds the nearest and best medical facilities that can treat the individual for the diagnosed illness or condition using grounding. The AI also utilizes grounding to inform the individual payment and insurance plan options that the suggested medical facilities can accept as payment for the treatment. "

    "* **Structured Output/JSON Mode/Controlled Generation**: For JSON Mode, I want to somewhat mimic the forms that patients fill out when they are requesting care from a medical facility, but simplier and more abstract. For Structured Output and Controlled Generation, I want my responses to be as accurate and precise as possible where creativity may not be required but accuracy is definitely required to get the best responses as possible.\n",
    "* **Few-Shot Prompting**: First of all, I want to create requests for the AI to know who it is providing information for, but I want the formatting of the requests to be as consistent as possible so that the information does not get muddled up which would make things more difficult for the AI to process and provide information for. Then, I also want to extract the zipcode from the JSON form, but sometimes the AI can hallucinate and return irrelevant or incorrect information, so I want the let the AI know how to return the zipcode correctly.\n",
    "* **Grounding**: This is the central capability of the AI since the AI is responsible for finding all the relevant possible nearest locations to the patient based on postal code/zipcode. Since we are exploring so many zipcodes and it is possible that the AI does not know every zipcode or medical facilities per zipcode, we need to rely on external sources to get the best answers possible. However, since we don't have a document listing out every medical facility per zipcode or all zipcodes, we would need to rely on the internet to give us answers. "

    "\n",
    "While the AI works as intended, this is a very basic setup/implementation of the AI (to be honest, I was short on time to implement the more advanced features/capabilities to make the AI run more efficiently and impressively; also for some reason, Python input does not work well or throws an error when implemented), and for the features that implement the grounding capabilities, the responses can be a hit-or-miss in terms of accuracy. Also, keep in mind that the AI is not a human doctor, and while humans can have personal biases or prone to error, at least a human doctor can also recognize the nuances that AI may not be able to recognize yet, and the diagnoses should not be taken as word of authority and more like potential warning or idea. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, possible next steps/future directions are as follows: \n",
    "* Convert AI to AI Agent using LangGraph\n",
    "* Implement interactive feature to AI where user can just input their information into the AI for the AI to process and then provide information as response\n",
    "* Implement UX/UI interface for AI\n",
    "* Upgrade JSON form to also include location information (such as address) and more demographic and health information (such as health history and income)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion and Potential Impact \n",
    "I created EmergencyZip AI as a more individualized and accessible and less overwhelming way for individuals to know what illness or medical condition they may be experiencing at the moment based on current symptoms and research the nearest appropriate medical facilities to get treatment based on zipcode/postal code as zipcode/postal code is indeed one of the most, if not the most, important factors in determining an individual's health status. Due to a time crunch, we implemented a basic implementation of the AI, but it works as well as we intended. \n",
    "\n",
    "I intended for the AI to empower individuals to make informed decisions that is best for their health and to know more and better of the variety of medical options provided for them to take care of their health, especially in illness and bad health (thus, we hope that with this AI, individuals take the initiative to become healthier and more health-conscious individuals). We also hope that the AI can help improve health outcomes for every zipcode/postal code as possible. "
